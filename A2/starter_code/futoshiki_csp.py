All models need to return a CSP object, and a list of lists of Variable objects
representing the board. The returned list of lists is used to access the
solution.

For example, after these three lines of code

    csp, var_array = futoshiki_csp_model_1(board)
    solver = BT(csp)
    solver.bt_search(prop_FC, var_ord)

var_array[0][0].get_assigned_value() should be the correct value in the top left
cell of the Futoshiki puzzle.

1. futoshiki_csp_model_1 (worth 20/100 marks)
    - A model of a Futoshiki grid built using only
      binary not-equal constraints for both the row and column constraints.

2. futoshiki_csp_model_2 (worth 20/100 marks)
    - A model of a Futoshiki grid built using only n-ary
      all-different constraints for both the row and column constraints.
    
    The input board is specified as a list of n lists. Each of the n lists
    represents a row of the board. If a 0 is in the list it represents an empty
    cell. Otherwise if a number between 1--n is in the list then this
    represents a pre-set board position.

    Each list is of length 2n-1, with each space on the board being separated
    by the potential inequality constraints. '>' denotes that the previous
    space must be bigger than the next space; '<' denotes that the previous
    space must be smaller than the next; '.' denotes that there is no
    inequality constraint.

    E.g., the board

    -------
    | > |2|
    | | | |
    | | < |
    -------
    would be represented by the list of lists

    [[0,>,0,.,2],
     [0,.,0,.,0],
     [0,.,0,<,0]]
